  "description": "The Geocoded Covariance Matrix dataset is the 4x4 Native Covariance Matrix geocoded to a spatial resolution of 25m using cubic interpolation methods.  These covariance matrix datasets provides the variability between retrievals for each co-registered single-look-complex (SLC) polarization and provide inferences on the scattering characteristics of a target.  The SLC data was collected from repeat-pass flights of the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) instrument during the AfriSAR field campaign over the Gabonese forest in February-March 2016.  The AfriSAR campaign was a collaborative airborne mission between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the European Space Agency and the Gabonese Space Agency collecting radar, lidar and field measurements in support of future space borne missions for biomass research.",
