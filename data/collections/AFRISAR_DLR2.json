  "description": "The ESA BIOMASS mission was selected in 2013 as the 7th Earth Explorer mission. BIOMASS will provide estimates of forest biomass and height with full coverage over the tropical areas exploiting the penetration capabilities of P-band. In order to further support the BIOMASS mission development, especially concerning the mission concept verification and the development of geophysical algorithms, ESA funded the AfriSAR campaign.During the AfriSAR campaign, shared between ONERA (dry season, July 2015) and DLR (wet season 2016), Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR airborne data set were collected over four test sites of Gabon (Africa), therefore covering different forest structures, biomass levels and disturbances. Although the interferometric / tomographic baselines were optimized for P-band acquisitions, L-band data were collected simultaneously as well.This reports describes the test sites, the available ground measurements (carried out in a parallel field inventory campaign in 2016) and Lidar data for the validation of the SAR product derivation and analysis. Furthermore, both campaigns are described in details, and data acquired and processed are listed. The results of data quality check are provided, together with first analyses aimed at investigating the potentials of the acquired data sets for generating Level-2 products in terms of Pol-InSAR forest height and TomoSAR vertical reflectivity profiles.",
