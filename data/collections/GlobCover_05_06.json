The aim of the project was to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using as input observations from the 300m MERIS sensor on board the ENVISAT satellite mission. The GlobCover land cover maps cover 2 periods: December 2004 - June 2006 and January - December 2009. This dataset provides the December 2004 - June 2006  data. ",
