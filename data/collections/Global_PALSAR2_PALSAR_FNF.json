  "description": "The global forest/non-forest map (FNF) is generated by classifying synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the global 25 meter resolution PALSAR-2/PALSAR mosaic dataset.  Backscatter for each pixel is classified as either \"forest\", defined as the tree covered land with an area larger than 0.5 ha and canopy cover over 10%, or \"non-forest\".  The map is generated yearly from 2007 through 2017.  Data is distributed as binary data files with ENVI headers.  The dataset provides spatiotemporal homogeneous forest classification which can be used to help understand and monitor responses to environmental changes. ",
